# mlb_slump_predictor

Python code to predict the timing and length of hitting slumps for the 2017 season.

The file "predictor.ipynb" explains the process in detail

Notes:
- Changes have been made to Scikit-learn's random forest regressor to improve accuracy. These changes have not been included, so mileage may vary.
- The iPython file references a csv titled "clean_data.csv". The existing copy of this file was too large, so it isn't included
